## 🎵 AI-Powered Music Generation with AudioCraft

This project explores how to generate original music compositions in various genres using **AudioCraft**, an open-source framework by Meta AI. The system leverages AI to create music based on input descriptions and allows users to customize the output by modifying prompts. The focus is on building a robust interface and experimenting with different prompts to produce diverse music pieces.

## Project Overview

The main goal is to develop an AI-based music generation system where users can describe their desired music styles and instruments, and the AI will generate corresponding audio. The project emphasizes the importance of **prompt engineering**, allowing for the generation of music across different genres and comparing the quality of outputs based on various inputs. A user-friendly interface will also be created to enable real-time interaction and music generation.

### Key Features:

- 🎶 **AI-Generated Music**: Generate original music based on descriptive prompts.
- 🎤 **Diverse Genres**: Experiment with multiple genres and musical instruments.
- 🎛️ **Interactive UI**: Build an interface where users can input text prompts and get AI-generated music.
- 🔀 **Compare Outputs**: Analyze and compare how different prompts lead to variations in the generated audio.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for developing the music generation system.
- **PyTorch**: For leveraging the AudioCraft framework and AI-based music generation.
- **Meta AI’s AudioCraft**: Open-source AI framework for music generation.

## 🤖 Skills Applied

- Machine Learning
- AI Frameworks
- Prompt Engineering

## Example Tasks You Can Do

- **Generate Music**: Input a description like "calm classical piano" and hear AI-generated music matching the style.
- **Experiment with Prompts**: Test out different prompt variations to see how the AI generates different outputs.
- **Interactive UI**: Use the user interface to control the music generation process with buttons and text inputs.
